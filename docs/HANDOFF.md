# Lantern Row handoff

## Tier 1 · Local campaign

The three nights are playable through the ending. The Row has a keyboard and mouse interface, state-driven stall lighting, six boat positions, wishes, a compact action guide, and audio cues. The campaign includes scarcity prices, trade and haggling, merchant memory, crafting and orders, NPC traders, dock jobs, rescue and expansion offerings, strategy votes, dividends, cart upgrades, and three IndexedDB slots with backup, export, and import.

The Zod protocol and development provider interfaces are checked in. There are 36 deterministic golden files and a bot playthrough through the local backend. The live tests separately cover contention, retry, a restart during delayed settlement, and unknown-to-confirmed or unknown-to-rejected settlement.

## Tier 2 · Living market

The reference server runs The Row continuously, supports four human seats per room, and keeps private rooms and public Watch available. The chronicle, price and balance history, share board, buybacks, simulator, layered music, and browser tests are implemented. A player bot trades for 20 nights in the accelerated server test, and the loop completes 500 nights without a real-time wait.

## Tier 3 · Extra polish

Endless unlocks after the campaign, carries the wallet and shares forward, and alternates festival and freight schedules. The later cart upgrade and forty preset wishes are available. Settings include independent volume controls, larger panels, low graphics, and reduced motion.

[Known issues](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) records differences from the reference brief, including the separate offline campaign and the development server's reservation queue.

## Verification

- A clean `npm ci` restored the Node.js 24 workspace. The production build type-checked the client, server, tools, and tests. The static output is 1.84 MB.
- `npm test` passed 61 tests covering local rules, the full campaign, 36 golden cases, the development providers, server races and restart recovery, and the 500-night live loop.
- `npm run test:e2e -- --workers 2` passed six production-build browser tests. Chrome and Firefox each played the campaign from an empty slot through the rescue, vote, finale, reload, and Endless. Each browser also ran the two-context order race and visited Watch and History without signing in.
- The CLI ran 2,000 nights each for seeds 17, 42, 93, 166, and 271. The five runs recorded zero invariant errors. See [Balance report](BALANCE_REPORT.md).
- The campaign recording shows the Oil Wharf shuttered, the pledge reopening it, and the boats lighting. The README includes three captured game screens and a short GIF.

## Provider integration

[API](API.md) has separate steps and file paths for replacing IdentityProvider, SettlementProvider, StateStore, and AuthClient. The reference selects local development providers. [Running](RUNNING.md) describes static hosting, the API URL, and local and server save locations.
